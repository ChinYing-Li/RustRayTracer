## Introduction
Never tried any system program language besides C++, I decided to give Rust a shot - and here's the CPU-based toy raytracer! 
The project is based on "Ray-tracing From the Ground Up" by Kevin Sufferin, though the design was adjusted to make the ray tracer more "Rustic". 

## Dependencies
- Rust (see [official Rust guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) for installation instructions)

## Build
1. Go to a preferred directory and `git clone https://github.com/ChinYing-Li/RustRayTracer.git`
2. `cd RustRayTracer`
3. `cargo run`

## To-Do
1. Fix bug in KD Tree
2. Implement Config struct to enhance the process of setting up
   various necessary objects
3. Add documentation
